Markets are pricing semantic relevance instead of actual vocabulary usage. The goal is that the markets are dramatically overpricing trendy corporate buzzwords while underpricing core business terminology. This creates arbitrage opportunities for disciplined traders. Bet on what companies actually say, not what makes conceptual sense. The fundamental advantage comes from tedious research arbitrage: Most traders don’t read transcripts: They bet on intuition and to them buzzwords feel important. The edge is boring statistical work beats exciting speculation.
