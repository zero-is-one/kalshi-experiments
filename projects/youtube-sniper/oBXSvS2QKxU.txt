#1 jet ski racer on the planet:
dj khaled.

i'm ready to go.
i don’t care who's on a jet ski.
-well--
-you know i run the ocean.
-you, you’re-
-i am gonna come out on top.
well, you're not racing someone
that's using a jet ski.
uh, you'll see.
-you're cleared for takeoff.
-takeoff?
just look right over there.
you're racing the #1 jet suit racer
on the planet.
i don't know what that is.
i didn't either,
but apparently,
people actually race in jet suits.
and this guy is the best
in the world.
so is there a trophy?
is there…
yeah, the winner gets a huge trophy.
-ok, cool.
-yeah, i'll take that.
um, hey, can we get a trophy made
before the end of the race, please?

the challenge is simple.
dj khaled will be on a jet ski
while issa takes to the skies.
and the first person to complete
one lap through our course
is the winner.
gentlemen, are you ready?

go! go!
and they’re off.
alright, dj khaled is in the lead.
but issa’s right behind him,
and he’s catching up.
they're turning the first corner now.
[dj khaled] woo! woo!
oh he’s catching up! he’s so close!
issa’s going faster
on the straightaway!
[jimmy] oh, no!
[majd] he’s just blastin’!
[jimmy] he caught up to khaled.
[majd] go, khaled, go!
but it's not over.
wait he could still actually win.
these turns are where
the jet ski will go faster.
khaled can gain ground.
go, go!
khaled go faster!
there's only a few turns left.
this is your last chance
to be the greatest.
[majd] wait, khaled’s catching up!
go, khaled, go!
go, go!
woo! woo!
[jimmy] what are you doing?
go, khaled, go!
the race is still going,
but khaled’s celebrating?

oh my gosh. i think issa did it!
that was a blowout.

and then there's dj khaled.
[dj khaled] we the best!

you won, but khaled is celebrating
like he won.
woo! it feels so good to win.

-brother.
-bro, i won.
brother, we all winners.
-you're gonna have to take--
-another one.
make sure my trophy's ready.
imma put it
beside all my other trophies.
alright, let's go
to the next challenge.
you definitely won,
but it’s fine.
congrats, khaled!
i've brought back a couple of people
you might recognize.
we have speed,
ronaldo’s biggest fan on the planet
going against khalid,
who defeated ronaldo,
the best soccer player in the world.
which, i don't know,
might make khalid
the best soccer player in the world.
if speed wins, i will give
a random fan of his 100 grand.
if khalid wins,
he gets 100 grand instead.
sorry speed fans.
let's go. let's go.
alright, the rules
to this game are simple.
first person
to hit three targets wins.
exactly like the game
you beat ronaldo in.
back then i said it's a 50/50 chance,
but now it's like 90/10.
whoa. you're that confident?
he's still confident.
he beat ronaldo.
ronaldo wasn't trying, so now he
thinks he’s all rainbows and horses.
-let's go!
-everyone back up.
good luck.
ok speed, $100,000
for your fans on the line.
for ronaldo and my fans.
i gotta do it for them.
will he hit a target?
hit it.
[jimmy] ooh.
where'd that go?
speed completely whiffed
his first shot.
let's see
if khalid can go up by one.
[tareq] oh, he got close.
[speed] he's too accurate.
oh my god.
that was close.
alright, speed's going right into it.
what's going through your mind?
bro, beast is like.
bro. he's like--
beast. beast,
beast, beast, beast.
jimmy, give him some space, bro.
my bad. i'm sorry.
that was chandler, not a target.
[karl] chandler is not red and white.
[jimmy] alright, it's on you.
whenever you're ready.
you don't have to keep
going easy on him.
the slow mo.
oh!
[khalid] let's go!
c’mon, bro.
out my face, bro.
oh my god.
in his face.
bro, congrats.
i think speed's actually getting mad.
well, if speed doesn't hit this,
he might be doing what ronaldo did.
ooh, it's just under.
are you gonna show no mercy?
are you gonna ronaldo him?
[majd] oh my god!
[taeq] that’s two!
oh my gosh.
[jimmy] speed!
do it for your fans.
alright, surely he hits one.
[jimmy] oh my gosh.
i've known speed
for a while,
and i could tell
that he was actually getting mad.
oh my god.
this is literally to a t
what happened to ronaldo.
you’re about to beat speed
after beating ronaldo.
no shot.
no shot he just ends right here.
no shot.
[jimmy] oh!
speed, i can't believe
i'm saying this but
you're about to get 3-0’d by khalid.
i hope ronaldo isn’t watching.
-[tareq] oh! he hit it! let's go.
-[jimmy] he got it!
he got a point!
you're in this now, man.
bro, he's so locked in.
this is the quietest
i've ever seen speed in my life.
[jimmy] oh my goodness.
[karl] it's a beautiful goal.
this is aura if he wins.
[karl] this one’s for ronaldo.
-[jimmy] oh! so close.
-[majd] oh my gosh.
they kept going back and forth.
and even though khalid was confident,
he was struggling
to make that final shot.
[majd] let’s go, speed!
[tareq] feet is not changing.
he tied it! he tied it!
he's not even saying a word.
[tareq] 2-2!
speed, the world wants to know.
what-- something, give us something.
ronaldo.
whoever hits the final target wins.
khalid, you could end it here.
if you don't…
he could end it.
[tareq] oh my god.
[jimmy] the dagger!
[majd] i tryna to hype you up!
i couldn't believe it.
these two kept going back and forth,
and i knew that in any moment,
either one of them could win
the $100,000.
this is speed's opportunity
to end it all.
get the dub.
oh, he did it!
he got it!
congrats to this speed fan
for winning $100,000!
ggs bro.
gg bro.
this is the strongest man
in the world.
later in the video,
we're gonna see
if he can win a tug of war
against 100 kids.
but first,
to showcase how strong he is
he’s seeing
if he can pull this plane
weighing over 50,000 pounds
over 75 feet.
this is who you guys
will be going up against!
he got nothing on me.
go!
[grunting]
it's not budging.
[cheering]
[grunting]
wait a minute.
it's moving!
he is literally pulling a plane.
this is your opponent.
what?
[jimmy] oh my gosh.
[kid] we’re gonna win!
[kid] you suck!
[jimmy] oh my god!
[jimmy] oh! oh!
he just pulled a plane!
do you think
you can beat him in tug-of-war?
we'll find out later in the video.
for this next 1v1,
we crashed
a savannah bananas baseball game.
hi, everybody!
how you guys doin’?
before i came out here,
out of 40,000 people,
i had them pick two random seats.
so will kyla w. and bowin h.
come on down?
so here's what we're gonna be doing.
chandler, come on out.
if chandler gets on base,
she will win $50,000…
come on, hit the ball!
alright, that's the goal.
but if the tailgaters get him out
or anyone in the stadium
catches the ball,
he will win $50,000.
three pitches,
three strikes.
i got you, man.
$50,000 at bat
in front of 40,000 people, chandler.
good luck.
here comes the first pitch.
strike one!
your odds are not looking
too good so far.
if he gets three strikes, he's out.
come on!
here's the next pitch.
oh, man.
it's going into the stands!
if a fan catches that, he's out.
let’s go!!
sorry, chandler. you're out!
to that fan over there
that caught the baseball
and won you $50,000,
what do you want to say to them?
thank you for $50,000.
i just showed up to this game
and won $50,000
because chandler sucks.
so, of course we found the fan
that caught the ball
and brought him down to the field
because we wanted to also give you
$10,000 for getting chandler out.
let's go!
chandler, what do you want
to say to him?
he's the reason you got out.
why would you do that to me?
my bad, my bad.
it’s alright. congrats.
chandler, that was embarrassing.
i know, i'm a little sad.
i'll put up another 50 grand
if you wanna run it back.
i do!
but since this
was an actual baseball game,
we'll have to wait
for the next inning to end.
alright, it's time.
if chandler gets on base,
kyla here--
unlike last time--
will win $50,000.
but if the tailgaters get him out,
then brian, the fan
that caught chandler's foul ball
will win $50,000
on top of his 10,000.
what do you wanna say
to chandler over there?
all he has to do
is get on first base.
keep your eye on the ball…
and make sure
you use your hips.
what do you have to say
to your pitcher right here?
i need you, bro.
-i got you.
-i need you, bro.
this is chandler's last chance.
it's time to lock in.
here comes pitch #1.
swing and a miss!
one strike.
he has one strike,
but we’re still good.
it all comes down to this moment.
all chandler has to do
is get to first base.
oh! oh!
[kyla] go, go, go!
it's gonna be close!
[jimmy] aww!
your dad just won fifty grand!
yeah, let’s go!
is your dad the coolest dad now?
yeah!
anything you wanted to say, chandler?
umm… i'm sorry?
yeah. let's, uh--
let's go to the next bit.
next up, we have one of the closest
competitions we've ever done.
if this amateur, johnny,
can manage to hit this golf ball
all the way to the middle of the lake
and hit this tesla,
he keeps it.
and, no joke, johnny is literally
a random guy found on a golf course.
are you subscribed to mrbeast?
yeah. for sure.
are you free
for the next couple hours?
i can be.
come with me.
but, if two-time major champ
bryson dechambeau,
one of the greatest
golf players alive,
hits it first,
i will give his biggest fan
the tesla instead.
let's go.
and obviously, since he's
the best golf player in the world,
we're gonna give you three shots
for every one he gets.
good luck.
good luck.
alright johnny,
you're up first.
three, two, one!
[majd] oh my gosh.
[bryson] oh my gosh,
that might actually hit it.
[majd] wait, that actually
might snipe it!
[jimmy] did he do it?
[all] oh! oh!!
-it hit right in front of the tesla!
-it’s right before!
oh, i'm getting real nervous.
[jimmy] alright, two more.
[fan] ah, there you go.
left, left!
wait. that one was way off.
alright, i gotta get it right here.
last shot,
and then it's bryson's turn.
[chandler] oh…
[fan] turn right!
[johnny] turn!
[all] oh!
oh my gosh, that almost hit me.
alright, bryson,
i need a ride home.
the bus dropped me off,
so i don't wanna carry these clubs
all the way back.
hey, come on.
bro, is he gonna one-shot it?
come on, bryson rochambeau.
best golf player on the planet.
[fan] go, ball! get left!
[tareq] oh, whoa! whoa!
[jimmy] aw, to the right!
[bryson] got three more shots.
nothing special here.
[jimmy] is that it?
-[fan] get away from it!
-[johnny] oh, come on!
[johnny] that's it!
right over top.
this is his second.
[fan] that took a good turn, baby!
come on!
[johnny] no…
oh!!
it hit the dock, but not the tesla!
that was so close!
three more shots, johnny.
you're not gonna get many
more chances.
[johnny] aw, yanked it again.
[jimmy] karl!
we're good!
and while they're whiffing,
let's talk about
our brand feastables.
we just released a 70-count pack,
and it has all of our favorite
flavors in mini sizes.
milk chocolate, milk crunch,
and creamy peanut butter cups.
that’s pretty good.
this is the most feastables
you can get one bag,
and it's exclusively available
at costco.
it’s here just in time for halloween,
so get yours today.
[jimmy] thanks, karl.
now watch your head.
[fan] there it is!
[bryson] please, please, please.
[jimmy] is that the money?
-[fan] oh, my--
-[bryson] no way!
[chandler] whoa!
[johnny] what?
[chandler] that is crazy.
[majd] johnny, you got this!
[johnny] no…
really yanking it.
alright, my turn.
[fan] that's it.
[fan] get left.
[jimmy] it's on point.
[fan] oh, my--
go, ball!
[karl] that might be it.
[fan] that's it.
-[fan] oh, the dock again…
-[bryson] oh my gosh!
that landed right in front of us!
this is rigged.
completely rigged.
you need to lock in, johnny.
bryson keeps getting closer.
this might be your last chance.
[fan] no!
[majd] fore!
[jimmy] heads, heads!
the amateur’s getting tired.
are you tired, johnny?
do you want chandler
to get a shot in for you?
i can do in five tries right now.
oh, my gosh, he called it out.
let’s see what we got here.
oh, chandler's hitting now?
dude wait, i’m gonna piss him off.
beep the horn as soon
as he hits it.
chandler is subbing in for johnny,
but it will still count for him.
who honked at my swing?
if it's nolan,
i'm gonna kill him.
he's gotta be mad!
chandler, this is your team's
third shot.
this could be your last chance.
[nolan] chandler doesn't
have a chance.
[chandler] oh, man.
oh, yeah!
[johnny] chandler, i'm begging you.
[jimmy] what are you doing?
[overlapping voices] chandler--
chandler, chandler…
[karl] you got this, chandler!
lock in!
keep going.
keep turning! go!
[karl] oh, my--
oh!!
i did it!
i’m better than bryson dechambeau!
bryson, i have to walk.
[chandler] let's go.
congrats on the tesla!
woo!
chandler, you're better than
bryson dechambeau.
let's go to the next bit.
let's head to our final challenge
before 100 kids face off
with the world's strongest man.
up next, we have darius--
famously jumped higher than a tiger,
topping his own
world-record vertical leap--
doing a dunk contest vs. druski.
yes.
with a trampoline.
well, that helps.
there is one catch:
you will have to dunk
on this 10 foot goal,
but each round,
we’ll be raising its height
by half a foot
until one of you can dunk,
and the other can't.
let's see what
you're up against, druski.
darius is gonna be going first.
we're starting off
with your typical 10-foot hoop.
alright, lemme see if i still got it.
let's see, darius.
oh my gosh, wait!
yo, he just trick shotted on you!
-he said, a normal dunk’s too easy.
-that ain’t nothing. i got something.
boys, bring in the trampoline!
druski’s turn on a 10-foot goal.
we gonna have somebody test it
before i go up?
you worried you might break it?
'cuz you had some of your boys
set up some of this stuff.
you won't die.
ok. alright.
you'll be good.
make me like mike.
alright. michael jordan!
[cheering]
this is actually gonna be
an intense dunk contest.
hey, that trampoline work,
don’t it?
yeah. raise the goal to 10.5 feet!
on you.
the #1 jumper on the planet.
oh my gosh.
alright, 10.5 feet when you're ready.
make me like mike!!
come on, druski.
[druski] ah!
[all cheering]
-[majd] let's go!
-[tareq] are you ok?
ah!
druski! are you ok?
yeah, yeah.
alright. cool, cool.
where's the prize money?
it's about pride.
it's about showing up
the highest jumper on the planet--
no, i said prize, not pride!
yeah, it's about pride.
ok.
alright, 11 feet.
raise it up.
alright, surely he can do 11 feet.
[jimmy] ok, ok.
whoa, i think we're getting
to his limit.
[darius] 11.5, that's gonna be tough.
but i don't know
if druski can do 11, though.
i can do 11.
bring out the trampoline!
come on! let's go!
i can see him shaking.
you see him shaking?
yeah. druski, this is a big moment.
200 million people
are gonna watch this.
where's the $200 million man?
[jimmy] ok.
mm, maybe next time.
alright, druski, 11 feet.
this is gonna be interesting.
lebron james!
agh! [grunts]
[cheering]
[jimmy] let's go!
yeah!
let's go!
[nolan] watch out!
we gotta do the next one.
y’all chill out.
he made that look easy!
what’d i tell you?
to be honest druski,
i actually don't know
if he can do 11.5.
what?!
set it up!
i don't like, look--
oh my gosh! it's-
you can hoop?
that was a bucket.
that goal is terrifying.
bring in the ladder.
it’s a long way up.
oh my gosh.
darius, you touched
both feet in the air
when you beat luna the tiger.
but there's a difference
between jumping 12 feet
and getting your hand
in a ball in this rim.
is there any human on the planet
that can dunk on this goal?
we gon’ see.
the highest jumper on the planet!
let's see if he can do it.
[darius] let's do it!
[chandler] you want a lob?
-[darius] yeah.
-[chandler] yeah?
[jimmy] ok.
in front of the entire world,
can darius,
highest jumper on the planet…
[druski] woo!
dunk on an 11.5 foot goal?
chandler is gonna be alley-ooping it.
got my faith in you.
alright.
[jimmy] oh no!
he missed!
[nolan] no way!
druski, if you hit an 11.5 foot dunk,
you win!
yes!
-you got this, man.
-i got this.
everyone is gonna think
you're an athletic freak in nature.
-i was always an athlete.
-everyone will respect you now.
no, they always have…
put that ball in the hoop.
people have always respected me.
what are you talkin’ about man…
[tareq] let's go druski!
-off the backboard right?
-yeah.
alright you don't need that
anymore then.
ok.
-come on, man. don't let me down.
-deep breaths!
i got you.
druski, are you the most athletic man
on the planet?
-be honest.
-i am.
prove it right here.
come on druski!
i'm like vince carter!
[cheering]
oh my gosh!
[tareq] hey!
he's too fast!
yeah!
i've never seen him run
that fast before!
yes sir!
whoo!
i told you man, when we started this,
i was more athletic.
[coughs] y’all could
bring the water in. yeah.
-hey you need to sit down?
-no, it's good.
i told you.
you can jump higher than a tiger,
but not druski.
but not druski.
let's head to the next challenge.
and now, our grand finale
is one of the world's craziest
battles of strength.
this is the strongest man
in the world!
and he's gonna be playing tug of war
against these 100 kids.
that is a lot of kids!
that plane you were pulling earlier
weighed 50,000 pounds.
so in theory,
you should just be able to drag them.
it sounds so simple
when you say it.
well, simple doesn't mean easy
in this version of tug of war.
you'll have to pull the other team's
red marker across the red line,
and you'll win the round.
if you guys win,
i'll give you feastables!
yeah! [cheering]
-are you ready?
-yes!
are you ready?
yeah! [cheering]
three, two, one.
go!
[tareq] pull!
[nolan] pull with everything you got!
oh my god,
the kids just gained momentum!
fight! fight!
the rope’s across the line!
the kids just destroyed him!
alright, bring the rest of ‘em out!
i brought the 10 strongest men
on earth!
these guys are freakin’ huge!
i've never felt so small in my life.
[singing] you aren’t scary!
[singing] you aren’t scary!
standing in front of you
is over 2 tons
of raw muscle and power.
these titans have won strongman
competitions across the globe,
and together they can lift the weight
of 4 pickup trucks!
and now we're going to start adding
strong challengers to each new round
to see how many it takes
to beat 100 kids.
starting with 2019’s
official strongest man in the world!
alright, surely this time you can
resist, what, a couple seconds?
we better be able to.
it's past your bedtime!
go to sleep!
no!
alright.
three, two, one…
go!
[grunts]
the kids just yanked the rope!
oh my god, they're waxing ‘em!
[nolan] you got this!
oh my god!
stop!
[nolan] the kids just destroyed ‘em!
[cheering]
that was almost instant!
so this isn't going right.
i think we bring in 2 guys
this next time.
let's go! let's go!
now we're gonna up
the strong team to 4!
this should be… a little closer.
ready?! go!
[jimmy] oh my god,
the strong team isn't budging!
[nolan] pull with everything you got!
[jimmy] the kids are pulling
them now!
oh! oh, the kids are winning!
the kids are winning!
[tareq] this is too easy!
whoa! they just destroyed ‘em!
well, since 4 still
wasn't enough to win,
we upped the strong team to 6.
go!
this round started off neck and neck,
but then the kids dug deep
and dragged the strong team
over the line.
light work! easy!
[jimmy] that's crazy.
eight absolute giants
are stepping up to the rope!
if the kids wanna take this round,
they're gonna have to give it
everything they've got!
three. two. one. go!
pull!
oh, they're holding ‘em back!
pull!
the men are standing their ground!
pull!
the kids are pulling them now!
[nolan] oh, this is closer!
but the kid's got it!
[cheering]
we’re aura!
light work! light work!
